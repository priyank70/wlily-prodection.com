                        <hr>
                        <p>Computer consoles, audio equipment and display equipment usually malfunction from time to
                            time. The malfunction can be due to something as simple as a loose connection or burned out
                            fuse or as complicated as a fried circuit board due to a power surge or overloading.
                            Whatever the cause of the malfunction, the technicians at Wiley Production will be happy to
                            troubleshoot your system and identify the underlying issues before they can carry out the
                            necessary repairs. We understand that you have the highest quality equipment, so we take the
                            greatest care while troubleshooting and repairing the system to prevent further damage. We
                            know that there is nothing as bad as hiring an AV repair firm for minor repairs only to end
                            up with a “dead” AV system. That’s why we have hired the most competent technicians to take
                            care of all your AV repair needs.</p>

                        conference halls and even homes. All our AV systems are designed to meet international standards

                        designs can be considered complete without the client’s input. Our professionals usually make

                        <p>Our team has previously installed different types of AV systems for different
                            types of clients. This means they have the requisite experience needed to install innovative
                            AV systems for all our clients. The experience we have in the industry also means that we
                            get the job done the first time round. Whichever type of AV system, or setup, you want, our
                            team has probably handled similar setups in the past. When you choose to work with an
                            experienced system designer and installer, you can expect to get the best outcomes.</p>
